# Mozart Launcher

This directory contains the Launcher, a simple tool for launching an
application as the root view of a new view tree attached to the
frame buffer and input.

It's intended as scaffolding to test UI applications which implement
the ViewProvider interface while we build the higher level parts of
the system.

## USAGE

  mojo:launcher <app url>
